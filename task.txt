1. Read files shapes.txt
	file contains multiple lines
	every line contains letter C,R,T (shapes.Circle, shapes.Rectangle, shapes.Triangle)
	followed by every edge coordinates (x , y)
	(circle has 0 edges followed by center point and any point of circle)
2. Create interface shapes.Shape with methods calculatePerimeter and calculateArea
3. Create class for shapes.Circle, shapes.Rectangle, shapes.Triangle (every class should implement shape)
4. Output everything to file (shape name, every side length, perimeter, area)
